# Cloudflare for OctoberCMS

*Ensure that HTTPS and IP detection works flawlessly with Cloudflare and OctoberCMS*

This super-simple plugin ensures compatibility with Cloudflare Flexible and Full SSL, even when behind a load balancer.

## Installation

Before using Cloudflare Flexbile SSL, we reccomend you remove any http -> https redirections in your .htaccess that you may have added. We find it safer to make this kind of redirection as a page rule in Cloudflare. Install this plugin and thats it! 

No configuration is necessary.
